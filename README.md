Collabvault is a Multi-Sig Collaborative Custody Provider project that aims to create a service that provides secure and collaborative custody of Bitcoin. The service creates a 2-of-3 multi-sig wallet, where the user holds two of the keys and the service holds one. 

This ensures that users have control over their own funds and that the service cannot move any user funds as they only possess a single key. The service also allows users to request a signature from the service key in the event that they do not have access to one of their keys. The project also includes hardware wallet integration, where the user can sign with their hardware wallet.
